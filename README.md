## 📈 Learning Path

1. **Start** with Pack 1 to build terminology and data handling skills.  
2. **Add probabilistic intuition** in Pack 2 (language modeling & classical classifiers).  
3. **Learn neural basics** in Pack 3 (embeddings, MLP/CNN, training dynamics).  
4. **Explore semantics/structure** in Pack 4 (lexicons, WordNet, parsing primer).  
5. **Apply to core tasks** in Pack 5 (POS, NER; MT overview).  
6. **Master sequences** in Pack 6 (RNN → LSTM → attention intuition).  
7. **Scale up** in Pack 7 (Transformers, LLMs, prompting, HF pipelines).  
8. **Reflect responsibly** in Pack 8 (bias, fairness, safety, reproducibility).

> 💡 Recommended pacing: ~1 pack/week with labs. Integrate a **term project** spanning Packs 2–7.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- **Explain** key NLP concepts (tokenization, morphology, semantics, syntax).  
- **Build** classical models (n-grams, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and **evaluate** them with proper metrics.  
- **Train** neural models for NLP tasks; **use** embeddings and understand optimization/batching.  
- **Implement** sequence models (RNN/LSTM) and **reason** about attention at a high level.  
- **Use** modern tooling (Hugging Face Transformers) for downstream tasks with prompting/fine-tuning.  
- **Assess** datasets/models for bias, fairness, and ethical risks; **document** models with concise reports.
