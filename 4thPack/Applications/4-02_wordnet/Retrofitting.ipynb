    "This notebook explores the use of retrofitted word vectors. Retrofitting is a process that adjusts pre-trained word vectors (like GloVe) to better align with semantic lexicons, such as WordNet. This encourages words that are synonyms or in the same conceptual set (synset) to have more similar vector representations. The technique is based on the paper by [Faruqui et al. (2015)](https://github.com/mfaruqui/retrofitting)."
